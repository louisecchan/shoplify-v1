      'We think of ourselves as hands-on curator. For us make is integral to our
      design philosophy. It is crucial how a piece of clothing feels when worn.
      We’ve always wanted clothes to be the way we drew them – relaxed and lived
      in, a natural look. We find men’s clothes interesting in their structure,
      feel and functionality. We started by designing men’s clothes, and then
      found that women wanted them. We're inspired by the authenticity we can
      find in nature, people and places, and we think it is the same quality we
      look for in the materials we choose. For example, the feel of hand-woven
      Harris tweed and the irregular slub of Irish linen. We feel passionate
      about landscape, and its connection with such fabrics and the skilled
      people who weave them. We like to work with manufacturers who understand
      and share this passion for make and quality of fabric: specialists such as
      John Smedley in fine-gauge knitwear, Mackintosh and their part hand-made
      raincoats, and the Scottish knitting factories that continue their
      heritage of producing the best cashmere in the world. We also find these
      qualities in other people’s work. In 1970, We was encouraged by finding –
      at a jumble sale – an old, yet finely stitched pinstripe shirt. Today we
      still find it exciting to hunt out objects we consider to be well-made and
      enduring. In particular, mid-20th century products such as Anglepoise
      lamps, Ercol furniture, and Robert Welch stainless steel cutlery,
      represent the best of our heritage of timeless functional design. We enjoy
      pulling these threads of tradition, quality and skill together in clothes
      that are meant to be worn in the real world, where good design is about
      living with thoughtful style.'
